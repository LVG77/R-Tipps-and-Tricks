# R-Tipps-and-Tricks
This repository contains solution to R newbie problems I encountered when learning this language.
Mainly mapping and tidyverse stuff.

(1) The instructions I post in this repository are most likely not solely my ideas but some kind of processed information. I include sources where I remember them (tutorials, blogposts etc).

(2) The codes are structural examples (how it looks like) and not stand-alone scripts to copy-paste. I will therefore not provide data on which I performed the code but rather the "idea" of the code comprising a code-sceletton with dummy variables.

Hope I can help some people getting over some obstacles :)
